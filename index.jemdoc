== About Me

I am currently a fourth year PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University. I am interested in data-related problems, and ultimately I hope to create something impactful that lies at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. At the moment, I am a member of [https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/ David Tse]'s group, and my research revolves around analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and understanding deep learning models[https://jenn.world .]
