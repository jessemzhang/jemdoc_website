== About Me

I am currently a fourth year PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University and an intern at [https://grail.com/ Grail]. I am interested in data-related problems, and ultimately I hope to create something impactful that lies at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. I am a member of [https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/ David Tse]'s group, and my research revolves around analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and understanding deep learning models[https://jenn.world .]

I have also had the privilege of working for some wonderful organizations during my graduate and undergraduate careers including [http://www.bd.com/en-us/offerings/capabilities/genomics Cellular Research], [https://www.mc10inc.com/ MC10], [https://ll.mit.edu/ MIT Lincoln Laboratory], and [http://www.dana-farber.org/ Dana-Farber]. Please see my [http://stanford.edu/~jessez/Jesse_Zhang_CV.pdf CV] for more details.
